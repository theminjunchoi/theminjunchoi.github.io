## Case

I will focus on handling a subset of core MIPS instructions (MIPS subset)

- The arithmetic-logical instructions: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`

- The memory-reference instructions: `lw`, `sw`

- The conditional instructions: `beq`, `jump`

  

## Logic design basics

In the MIPS implementation, the datapath elements consist of

- **Combinational** elements

    - Operate on data values

    - Given inputs, a combinational element produces outputs

    - e.g., ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit), Adder, Multiplexer, AND-gate

- **State (sequential)** elements

    - Contain state

    - They have some internal storage

    - e.g., instruction and data memory, registers

</br>

  

Combinational elements work with state elements

- Getting inputs from state elements

- Giving outputs to state elements

  

## Clocking methodology

When data can be read and written is determined relative to the clock </br>

In this book, we assume **"Positive edge-triggered clocking methodology"**

  

Combinational elements works with state elements </br>

**In a single clock cycle = between clock edges = between rising edges**

- At one rising edge, combinational elements read inputs from state elements

- Before the next rising edge, combinational elements complete operations and produce outputs

- At the next rising edge, state elements are updated with the outputs

- **The longest delay determines clock period**

### State elements with two inputs

**State elements (e.g., registers) take two inputs: update data and a clock signal** </br>

Based on the clock signal, it is determined when to update the data

  

In positive edge-triggered clocking methodology, </br>

Update the data at rising edges (when the clock signal changes from 0 to 1)

</br>

  

### State elements with three inputs

**State elements take three inputs: update data and a clock signal with write control** </br>

Based on the clock signal and the write control, it is determined when to update the data

  

In positive edge-triggered clocking methodology, </br>

Update the data at rising edges + **when the write control input is 1**
