## Integrating TLB, Cache, Memory

### Aliasing in virtually addressed cache

- The same virtual address of different processes can be mapped to different physical address
	- Wrong cache hit can occur

- Different virtual addresses of different process can be mapped to the same physical address <br>(when some memory space is shared by multiple processes)
	- The physical memory can be cached in two different locations
	- Coherency problem can happen <br>One program writes the data without the other program being aware that the data had changed

<br>

  

#### Simple solution

- Flush cache at context switching -> too high miss rate
	- Context switch: In multi-process environments, multiple processes share a single CPU

<br>

  

## Hybrid cache: virtually-indexed  & physically-tagged cache

- No aliasing problem

- TLB & cache are accessed in a parallel manner (fast)

- 32-bit virtual address

- Page size = $2^p$ Bytes

- Physical memory size =  $2^t$ Bytes (t-bit physical address)

- Block size = $2^m$ words

- Num of sets in a cache = $2^s$ sets

### Typical multi-level cache setup with TLB

- Typical L-1: hybrid cache (virtually-addressed, physically tagged)
	- To reduce hit time and miss rate

- Typical L-2: physically-addressed cache
	- For simple implementation
	- In addition, usually L-2 si large<br>So, because p < s + m + 2, we cannot use hybrid cache
