## Main challenge in using main memory

In multi-process environments, multiple processes share main memory at the same time.

So depending on which processes run concurrently, the following thing are dynamically changed.

- The total amount of memory that each process can use

- The memory address of data used in processes

- The physical location of data (main memory or disk)

  

## Virtual Memory (VM)

**Provides each process an illusion of the exclusively-use of large memory** <br>

Processes think that they use their own memory that can store everything related to them

- CPU and OS manage the mapping between the virtual memory, physical memory and disk

<br>

  

### Advantages

- Processes do not need to think about the effect of other processes in using memory

    - The memory space used by processes is fixed virtually

    - Simple development of programs

- Virtual addresses of different processes are mapped to different physical addresses

    - Only OS can manage this mapping information

    - One process cannot access another's data

<br>

  

### Term

- **Page**: the minimum unit of information in virtual memory containing multiple blocks

- **Page fault**: when an requested page is not present in main memory

- **Virtual address**: an address that corresponds to a data location in virtual memory

- **Physical address**: an address that corresponds to a data location in physical memory

- **Disk address**: an address that corresponds to a data location in disk

<br>

  

### Address translation (address mapping)

In virtual memory, pages are mapped from virtual address to physical or disk addresses

- At this time, **fully associative placement** is used

<br>

  

### VM address translation

- 32-bit virtual memory address

- Virtual memory size: $2^{32}$ Bytes = 4GB

- Page size: 4KB = $2^{2+10}$ Bytes

- Physical memory size: 1GB = $2^{30}$ Bytes

- Num of physical pages = $2^{18}$

  

#### Total page table size

Num of PTEs $\times$ PTE size = num of virtual pages $\times$ 4Bytes<br>

= Virtual memory size / page size $\times$ 4Bytes<br>

= $2^{32} / 2^{12} \times 2^2$ Bytes = $2^{32 - 12 + 2}$ Bytes = 4MB

<br>

  

## TLB (translation Lookaside Buffer)

Since the page tables are stored in main memory, every memory access by a program can take at least twice as long<br>: one memory access to obtain the physical address and a second access to get the data<br>

<br>

**TLB** is a cache that keeps tract of recently used address mappings to try to avoid an access to the page table.<br>

### Typical TLB structure

- TLB size: 16 ~ 512 page entries

- Fully associative TLBs (used in systems that use small TLBs) <br>or Small associative TLBs (used in systems that use large TLBs)

- Replacement policy: random (for fast handling)

- Hit time: 0.5 ~ 1 clock cycle

- Miss penalty: 10 ~ 100 clock cycles

- Miss rate: 0.01% ~ 1%

<br>

  

### Integrating TLB, Cache, memory

- Fully-associative TLB

- Physical memory size = 4GB (=$2^{32}$)

- Page size = 4KB = (=$2^{12}$)

- Direct mapped cache

- Num of cache blocks = $2^8$

- Cache block size = $2^4$ word

### Workflow

- Access TLB first

- Access cache using physical addresses: "physically addressed cache"

<br>

  

### Physically addressed cache

- Physically indexed & physically tagged <br>Both the cache index and tag are physical addresses
![[05 6.jpg]]

<br>

  

- 32-bit virtual address

- Page size = $2^p$ Bytes

- Physical memory size =  $2^t$ Bytes (t-bit physical address)

- Block size = $2^m$ words

- Num of sets in a cache = $2^s$ sets

<br>

  

### Scenario

1. TLB -> hit, Cache -> hit, VM -> hit

    - Best case

    - TLB가 hit이므로 Page table 볼 필요가 없음

    - 즉 main memory 접근 필요 없음

    - 또 Cache가 hit이므로 TLB에 의해 가상주소 -> 실제주소, 이 실제주소로 Cache 접근

2. TLB -> miss, Cache -> hit, VM -> hit

    - TLB가 miss이므로 Page table에 접근해서 가상주소 -> 실제주소 변환 필요 (메모리 접근 1회 필요)

    - Cache는 hit이므로 더 이상 메모리 접근 없음

3. TLB -> miss, Cache -> miss, VM -> miss

    - Worst case

    - 최악의 경우로 memory에서 miss 발생 -> page fault

    - 즉 valid bit가 0이므로 OS가 제어를 넘겨받음

4. VM -> miss면, Cache와 TLB가 무조건 miss

    - 계층구조를 이루고 있기 때문에 hit가 생길 수 없음

<br>

  

### Virtually addressed cache

- Virtually indexed & virtually tagged <br>Both the cache index and tag are virtually address

<br>

  

- 32-bit virtual address

- Page size = $2^p$ Bytes

- Physical memory size =  $2^t$ Bytes (t-bit physical address)

- Block size = $2^m$ words

- Num of sets in a cache = $2^s$ sets
