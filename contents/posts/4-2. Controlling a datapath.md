## Controlling a datapath

### main control

Control signals are derived from given instructions

- `rs` is always being read

- `rt` is being read except when the instruction is `lw`.

    - It is for loading

### ALU control

- Load / store instructions: add

- Branch instructions: subtract

- R-format instructions: depends on a function field in the instructions

- Main Control Unit determines the `ALUOp` value

- Whatever the `funct` codes are, if the opcode is `lw`, `sw`, or `beq`, ALU fuction is determined automatically
