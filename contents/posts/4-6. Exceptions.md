## Code scheduling

There are three types of critical dependencies

- Read after write

- Write after read

- Write after write

If two instructions have one of the above dependencies,<br>

**the execution order these two instructions must be maintained**

  

## Exceptions

### Exceptions VS Interrupts in MIPS

- Exception: arises within the CPU (internally)

- Interrupt: from an external I/O controller (externally)

| Type of event                  | From where | MIPS terminology       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| I/O device reques              | External   | Interrupt              |
| Invoke OS from a user program  | Internal   | Exception              |
| Arithmetic overflow            | Exception  | Exception              |
| Using an undefined instruction | Internal   | Exception              |
| HW malfunctions                | Either     | Exception or interrupt |

### How to handle

- Step 1: Save the address of the offending instruction in the EPC (Exception Program Counter)

    - EPC is a 32-bit register

- Step 2: Save the reason for the exception in the Cause register

    - Cause is a 32-bit register (some bits are unused)

- Step 3: Jump to the exception handler corresponds to the cause

    - The handler address for undefined opcode: $8000\;0000_{hex}$

    - Overflow: $8000\;0180_{hex}$

    - But sometimes without saving the reason for the exception, it jumps to the exception handler

- Step 4: Do actions

    - Read the cause and determine the action required

    - If recoverable, take a corrective action and use EPC to return to a program

    - Otherwise, terminate the program and report error using EPC, cause, ...

### Exceptions according to the stage

Exceptions can occur in any stage (except WB)

- IF: Invalid memory access (memory fault)

    - e.g., when PC holds an invalid memory address value

- ID: Undefined instruction

    - e.g., `abc $t0, $t1, $t2`

- EX: Overflow

    - e.g., when we use add, addi, and sub instructions

- MEM: Invalid memory access (memory fault)

    - e.g., when a computed target memory address is abnormal

Regardless of the stage, the cause of exceptions is stored in the Cause register<br>

Then, guess which instruction caused the exception based on the cause

### Multiple exceptions

Multiple instructions are executed in different stages at the same time, which means multiple exceptions can occur in the same clock cycle.

#### How to prioritize multiple exceptions?

- In MIPS, earliest instruction first

- Flush subsequent instructions
