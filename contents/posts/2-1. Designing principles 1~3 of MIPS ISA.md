## MIPS ISA
### What is MIPS ISA
- Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages
- A kind of ISA

### Design principles
1. **Simplicity favors regularity**
2. **Smaller is faster**
3. **Make the common case fast**

## Design Principle 1
### Simplicity favors regularity
- **Regularity**: all MIPS arithmetic instructions include **a single operation & three operands** 
- Regularity makes implementation simpler 
- Simplicity enables higher performance at lower cost

### Examples
- add a, b, c
	- $a = b + c$
- sub a, a, d
	- $a = a - d$

## Design Principle 2
### Smaller is faster
- Operands of MIPS arithmetic instructions must be chosen in **a small number of registers**
- **Register**: Fast locations for data
- 32 32-bit registers in MIPS
- 32 is $2^5$ that can be represented by using 5 bits![[registers.jpg]]

## Practice 1
**C code:**
```c
f = (g + h) - (i + j)
```
**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
```
add $t0, $s1, $s2
add $t1, $s3, $s4
sub $s0, $t0, $t1
```

## Memory instruction
### Memory organization
keep a small amount data in **registers** and other remaining, complex data in **memory**
- **Load** values from memory into registers
- **Store** results from registers to memory
### Address
A memory address is an index to the memory array, starting at 0 
MIPS uses byte addressing (Each address identifies an 8-bit byte)

**But**, most data items are larger than a byte. So, they use "**words**" 
- In MIPS, a ward is 32 bits
- Registers also hold 32-bit of data
#### Alignment restrictions

- The start address of each data should be multiple of N, where N is the size of the data
- In MIPS, words must start at a addresses that are multiples of 4
- Some data items use one or two bytes (halfword)
#### Byte ordering
- Big endian(**MIPS**): place the most significant byte first and the least significant byte last
- Little endian: place the least significant byte first and the most significant byte last  
### Load/Store
- **lw reg1 offset(reg2)**: Load 32-bit word from the memory address reg2 + offset into reg1
- **sw reg1 offset(reg2)**: Store 32-bit word in reg1 at the memory address reg2 + offset
- **lh/sh** and **lb/sb** instructions load/store halfwords and 8-bit of data

## Practice 2
**C code:**
```c
g = h + A[8]
```
- A is an array of 4-bytes words
- The value of g and h are in `$s1` and `$s2`
- The base address of A is in `$s3`

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
```
lw $t0, 32($s3)
add $s1, $s2, $t0
```

## Practice 2
**C code:**
```c
A[12] = h+ A[8]
```
- A is an array of 4-bytes words
- The value of h is in `$s2`
- The base address of A is in `$s3`

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
```
lw $t0, 32($s3)
add $t0, $s2, $t0
sw $t0, 48($s3)
```

## Practice 3
**C code:**
```c
f = (g + h) - (i + j)
```
- f, g, and h are in `$s0`, `$s1`, and `$2` respectively
- Halfwords i and j are sequentially stored in memory
- The start address of i is stored in `$s3`

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
```
add $t0, $s1, $s2
lh $t1, 0($s3)
lh $t2, 2($s3)
add $t3, $t1, $t2
sub $s2, $t0, $t3
```

## Design Principle 3
### Make the common case fast
**Common case :** a program uses a small constant in an operation many times 

**Solution: support** 
- **16-bit immediate operands** for handling the constants
	- no need to access memory to load the constants
	- `addi $t0, $t0, 4` : addi is an add immediate instruction

- **MIPS register 0 (`$zero`)** contains the constant 0
	- `add $t0, $t1, $zero` : move values between two registers `$t0` and `t1`

## Practice 4
**C code:**
```c
f = A[10] - i + 4
```
- `A` is an array of bytes and its base address is stored in `$s0`
- `f` and `i` are stored in `$s1` and `$s2` respectively

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
```
lb $t0, 10($s0)
sub $t1, $t0, $s2
addi $s1, $t1, 4
```
  

## Summary: MIPS ISA

### Key underlying design principles

- Design principle 1. Simplicity favors regularity
	- All MIPS arithmetic instructions include a single operation & three operands
- Design principle 2. Smaller is faster
	- Operands of MIPS arithmetic instructions must be chosen in a small number of registers
	- MIPS keeps more complex data in memory and supports data transfer between memory and registers
- Design principle 3. Make the common case faster
	- Support 16-bit immediate operands for handling small constants + `$zero`
