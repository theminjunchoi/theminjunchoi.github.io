## Common HW design for MIPS ISA
![[HW design.jpg]]

**CPU, register, and memory**
- Control unit (CU) directs the operation of the processor
- Arithmetic & logic unit (ALU) does the operation
- `$0, ..., $31` hold the value that will be used in the operation (called general purpose register)
- Program counter (PC) contains the memory address of the instruction will be executed
- Instruction register (IR) contains the current instruction

**Execution of the instruction**
- Step 1 (fetch): CU says "load the instruction from the memory address in PC to IR"
- Step 2 (decode): CU says "the instruction stored in IR means `ADD $s0, $s1, $s2`
- Step 2 (execute): ALU does the add operation with the values in `$s1` and `$s2` and stores the computation result in `$s0`
## Operation
### Arithmetic operations
**Instructions for arithmetic**
| Operation | C    | Java | MIPS assembly language | Example             |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Add       | +    | +    | `add` (R), `addi` (I)  | `add $t0, $t1, $t2` |
| Subtract  | -    | -    | `sub` (R)              | `sub $t0, $t1, $t2` |

### Logical operations
**Instructions for bitwise manipulation**

| Operation   | C   | Java | MIPS assembly language | Example             |
| ----------- | --- | ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Bitwise AND | &   | &    | `and`(R), `andi`(I)    | `and $t0, $t1, $t2` |
| Bitwise OR  | \|  | \|   | `or` (R), `ori`(I)     | `or $t0, $t1, $t2`  |
| Bitwise NOR | ~   | ~    | `nor`(R)               | `nor $t0, $t1, $t2` |


MIPS has no NOT instruction 
Instead, it has **NOR R-type** instruction
- a NOR b == NOT (a OR b)
- But, we can do the NOT operation with NOR: `nor $t0, $t1, $zero!`

### Shift operations
| Operation    | C     | Java  | MIPS assembly language | Example                              |
| :----------- | :---- | :---- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Shift left   | <<    | <<<   | `sll` (R)              | `sll $s1, $s2, 10 ($s1 = $s2 << 10)` |
| Shift right  | >>    | >>>   | `srl` (R)              | `srl $s1, $s2, 10 ($s1 = $s2 >> 10)` |

- shamt: how many positions to shift
- Shift left/right logical (sll / srl)
	- Shift left/right and fill with 0 bits
	- (unsigned only) sll with i bits = multiply by $2^i$
	- (unsigned only) srl with i bits = divide by $2^i$


### Conditional operations

| Operation            | MIPS assembly language | Example                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Conditional branch   | `beq`(I)               | `beq $t0, $t1, LABEL` (if $t0 == $t1, goto LABEL) |
|                      | `bne`(I)               | `bne $t0, $t1, LABEL` (if $t0 != $t1, goto LABEL) |
| Unconditional branch | `j`(I)                 | `j LABEL` (goto LABEL)                            |

**Instructions for making decisions** 
Usually combined with goto statements and labels 
there are no branch instructions like blt (less than) and bge (greater than or equal to)


**Why?** 
- Handling <, >, <=, >=, ... is slower and more complicate than =, !=
- It will cause increase of instruction count and clock period or CPI

**Instead, MIPS provides others** 

| operation        | MIPS assembly language | Example                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set on less than | slt(R), slti(I)        | slt $t0, $t1, $t2 (if $t1 < $t2, $t0 = 1; else $t0 = 0) |


**slt is used in combination with beq and bne**
```
slt $t0, $t1, $t2
bne $t0, $zero, LABEL
beq $t0, $zero, LABEL
```
