## Pipelined datapath

We need registers between stages **to hold information produced in previous stage and make isolation**

## Data hazards

When an instruction depends on the completion of data access by a previous instruction, it causes data hazards.

### How to detect & when to forward

- **Step 1: Pass register numbers along pipeline**

    - if I-format or branch instruction, Rd is invalid value

- **Step 2: Check the following data hazard conditions**

    - `EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`

    - `EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`

    - `MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`

    - `MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`

- **Step 3: If there is a data hazard, then do forwarding**

    - But only if the forwarding instruction writes to a register

        - Check the RegWrite signal in `EX/MEM.RegWrite` and `MEM/WB.RegWrite` is `1`

    - And only if Rd for the forwarding instruction is not `$zero`

        - `$zero` cannot be overwritten

        - `EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0`

        - `MEM/WB.RegisterRd != 0`

<br>

  

### How to process

- **EX hazards**

    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`) <Br>**ForwardA = 10**

    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`) <Br>**ForwardB = 10**

- **MEM hazard**

    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRs`) <Br>**ForwardA = 01**

    - If (`EX/MEM.RegWrite == 1 && EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0 && MEM/WB.RegisterRd == ID/EX.RegisterRt`) <Br>**ForwardB = 01**

- **Both EX & MEM hazards**

    - Use the most recent result **(the result in EX/MEM)**

<br>

## Load-use data hazards

But, sometimes, we cannot avoid stalls by forwarding<br>

We need to stall for one cycle when we have to forward the data from MEM/WB registers to ALU stage
![[08 1.jpg]]

  

### How to detect & when to forward

- **Step 1: Check the following condition**

    - `ID/EX.MemRead == 1 &&` <br>`(ID/EX.RegisterRt == IF/ID.RegisterRs || ID/EX.RegisterRt == IF/ID.RegisterRt)`

- **Step 2: If detect, stall**

    - Prevent PC and IF/ID from changing<br>the same instruction is executed in IF & ID stages

    - Insert `nop` in the EX stage by setting the control signals in ID/EX register to 0

    - `PCWrite = 0`, `IF/IDWrite = 0` (if no load-use data hazards, they are 1)

  

### Practice

### Code scheduling

Reorder code to avoid the load-use data hazards (done by compiler)

#### Algorithm

- Check the existence of load hazards

    - A load hazard occurs when the destination register of a load instruction is used as a source register of its next instruction

- If exists, check whether there is a code that can ve executed after the load instruction

    - This reordering must not change the result of the program, while solving hazard

    - We must consider the instruction dependencies

<br>

  

## Control hazards

If branch outcome is determined in a MEM stage, there will be three pipeline bubbles
![[09 2.jpg]]

  

### How to process

- **Simple solution: static branch prediction**

    - Predict that the branch will not be taken (just the next instruction will be executed)

    - If the prediction is correct, there will be no pipeline stall

    - If the prediction is incorrect, flush 3 instructions and insert 3 pipeline bubbles

- **Improving by early comparison in ID stage**

    - Use same prediction

    - If the prediction is correct, there will be no pipeline stall

    - If the prediction is incorrect, flush 1 instruction and insert 1 pipeline bubble

- **Dynamic branch prediction**

    - History-based prediction with BPT(branch prediction table), store a recent branch decision (taken / not taken)

    - Indexed by branch instruction addresses

<br>

  

### Dynamic branch prediction

Make a better branch prediction in a way to reduce the number of misprediction

- Step 1: access a branch prediction table by using the instruction address

- Step 2: Check the prediction value in the table and fetch the next (not taken) or target branch instruction (taken)

- Step 3: If the prediction is wrong, flush pipeline and flip prediction

  

#### 2-bit predictor

Only change prediction on two successive mispredictions
![[10.jpg]]

  

#### Branch target buffer

Still, we should experience 1 pipeline stall to compute the target address for a taken branch

- Cache of target address

- Indexed by the address of branch instructions

- When a branch instruction is fetched and its prediction is "taken", <br>then check the branch target buffer

    - If there is a target address, fetch the target immediately
