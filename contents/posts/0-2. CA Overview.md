### Below your program

A simplified view of hardware and software
- **Applications software**
	- Written in high-level language
- **Systems software**
	- **Compilers**: translate high-level language to machine language
	- **Operating Systems**
		- Handle input/output operations
		- Manage resources (e.g., storage, memory)
		- Schedule tasks (processes)
- **Hardware**
    - processors memory, I/O devices
    

## Execution of programs
### Step 1: Translating language
- From high-level language
	- Designed for specific domain
	- Provides for productivity and portability
- To hardware machine language
	- Binary digits
	- Encoded instructions

### Step 2: Inputting, outputting, processing, and storing data
**4 Fundamental HW components**
- Processor
	- Datapath + control, our primary focus
- Memory
- Input device
	- Keyboard, mouse, ...
- Output device
	- Screen, speaker

**8 STEPS**
1) Loading: programs are stored in memory
2) Inputting: input device write data to memory
3) Fetching: processor fetches instructions and data from memory
4) Decoding: processor (control) decodes the instructions and determine what to do
5) Executing : processor (datapath) executes the instructions & stores the computation result to memory
6) Outputting: output device sends the result by reading output data from memory

## Understanding program performance

- Algorithm
	- Determines the number of operations executed
- Programming language, compiler, and instruction set architecture (ISA)
	- Determine the number of machine instructions executed per operation
- Processor and memory system
	- Determine how fast instructions can be executed
- I/O system (including OS)
	- Determines how fast I/O operations are executed

## What is ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
- An interface between SW snd HW (includes a set of machine instruction)
	- SW is translated into the machine instructions included in the ISA
	- HW is designed to support the instructions in ISA

## 8 great ideas for designing better computer architecture
- Design for **Moore's Law**
	- Anticipate where the technology will be when the design finishes
- Provide **abstraction** to simplify design
	- Hide low-level details for the ease of SW development
- Make **the common case** fast
	- Enhance performance of the common case instead of optimizing the rare case.
- Perform via **parallelism**
	- Perform operations in parallel
- Performance via **pipelining**
	- Use a particular patten of parallelism, called pipelining
- Performance via **prediction**
	- Start working with prediction, stead of waiting until you know for sure
- **Hierarchy** of memories
	- Use the fastest, smallest, and most expensive memory at the top of the hierarchy and the slowest, largest, and cheapest memory at the bottom
	- cache > RAM > Large SSD
- Dependability via **redundancy**
	- Include redundant components that can take over when failure occurs
