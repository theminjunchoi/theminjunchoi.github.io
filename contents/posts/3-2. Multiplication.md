## Multiplication

If a multiplicand and a multiplier have **m** and **n** digits, the product has at most **m + n** digits

- MIPS-based computers use **32-bit** word for the arithmetic operations

- The product in MIPS-based computers has at most **64 digits**

</br>

  

### Optimized version of the multiplication HW

- 32-bit multiplicand register / ALU

- 64-bit product register (multiplier shares a register with product)

    - `HI`: most significant 32 bits

    - `LO`: least significant 32 bits

    - Actually, there is one more bit in the left of the product register to hold the carry out of the adder

</br>

  

### Settings

- 0 is stored in the left half of the product register

- The multiplier value is loaded into the right half of the product register

- The multiplicand value is loaded into the multiplicand register

</br>

  

### Multiplication Algorithm

#### Example

When N = 4 (4-bit ALU / multiplicand, 8-bit product), $2 \times 3$

- should be **repeated as many bits as it is**

### Signed multiplication

Do multiplication after converting both multiplicand & multiplier to positives

- For 31 iterations (except a sign bit)

- After the multiplication, negate the result (if it is required)

Better solution: Booth's Algorithm

- Supports multiplication of two's complement signed numbers in a more efficient way

- Requires almost same hardware with the multiplication of unsigned numbers

</br>

  

### Instructions

- `mult rs, rt / multu rs, rt` (rs: multiplicand, rt: multiplier)

    - The result (product) is stored in `HI` / `LO`

- `mfhi rd / mflo rd`

    - Move from `HI` / `LO` to rd

#### Example: `mult $t0, $ t1`

- `$t0` (multiplicand) is used as the Multiplicand register

- Initially, the value in `$t1` (multiplier) is loaded into `LO` register

- Then, do the multiplication and store the 64-bit product to `HI` and `LO` registers
