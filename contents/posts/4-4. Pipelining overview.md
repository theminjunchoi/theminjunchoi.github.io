Because the longest delay determines clock period, a single-cycle implementation is not used today <br>

It violates **"make the common case fast"**

  

## Pipelining overview

With the pipelined approach, the speed up can be equal to the number of stages in an ideal case

- A single task is divided into N stages

- Each stage takes teh same amount of time T

- There are M tasks, where M is large enough

  

To complete all the tasks

- In non-pipelined approach, we need $N \times M \times T$ times

- In pipelined approach, we need $(N + M - 1) \times T \approx M \times T$ time

  

$$

Time\;between\;tasks_{pipelined} = \frac{Time\;between\;tasks_{non-pipelined}}{Number\;of\;pipeline\;stages}

$$

<br>

  

### Stage in pipeline

For different stages, different resources are used.

- Stage 1: IF (Fetching an instruction from memory)

- Stage 2: ID (Decoding the instruction and read registers)

- Stage 3: EX (Executing operation or calculating address)

- Stage 4: MEM (Accessing data in data memory)

- Stage 5: wB (Writing the result back into a register)

<br>

  

### Compared to the single-cycle processor

Compared to the single cycle processor, **clock period in pipelined processor is determined by the longest stage time.**

<br>

  

$$

Time\;between\;instructions_{pipelined}= the\;longest\;stage\;time \times (the\;number\;of\;instructions + the\;number\;of\;stages - 1)

$$

  

**If there are a lot of instructions to be executed,**

$$

Time\;between\;instructions_{pipelined} = \frac{Time\;between\;instructions_{non-pipelined}}{\frac{the\;longest\;instruction\;time}{the\;longest\;stage\;time}}

$$

## Hazards in Pipelining

- Structural hazards

    - When a required resources is busy

- Data hazards

    - When we need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write operation

- Control hazards

    - When we need to make a control decision differently depending on the previous instruction

<br>

  

### Structural hazards

When a required resource is already used for executing an other instruction

- IF and MEM stages can request to use the same resource at the same time

- it is required to separate instruction / data memories

    - IF and MEM stages use different part of memory (instruction memory, data memory)

### Data hazards

When an instruction depends on the completion of data access by a previous instruction

Solution: **Forwarding** <br>

Instead of waiting for the target date to be stored in a register,<br>

forward the data as soon as possible with extra connections

#### Load-use data hazards

But, sometimes, we cannot avoid stalls by forwarding
![[05 4.jpg]]


  

Solution: **code scheduling**<br>

Reorder code to avoid the load-use data hazards (done by compiler)

### Control hazards

Hazards with branch instructions <br>

We should wait until branch outcome is determined before fetching the next instruction

Solution: **Compare registers and compute target early in the pipeline**

- Especially, by adding hardware to do it in **ID stage**

- But, still there is **one** pipeline bubble

![[09.jpg]]
  

Solution: **branch prediction**

With additional HW for early comparison and computation in ID stage

- just fetch instruction with no bubble

    - if prediction correct: keep going

    - if prediction incorrect: cancel the process & add bubble

<br>

  

## Summary

**Pipelining improves performance by increasing instruction throughput**

- Executes multiple instructions in parallel

- The execution time of each instruction is not affected

  

**Pipeline hazards**

- Structural hazards

    - Solution: separate data / instruction memories

- (Load-use) Data hazards

    - Solution: forwarding + code scheduling

- Control hazards

    - Solution: early comparison & computation + branch prediction
