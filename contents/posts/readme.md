## 😄 Introduction  
Hi there! I’m **Minjun Choi** — a problem solver who’s always thinking about how to build services that actually solve problems and make a real impact. I care deeply about creating meaningful value through the code I write, not just clean features but outcomes that drive business and help people. I’m on a journey to keep learning, building, and contributing to something bigger than myself. Curious about what I’m working on? Check out my [blog](https://minjun.blog/)!
