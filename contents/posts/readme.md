## 😄 Introduction  
Hey, I'm Minjun Choi — a problem solver who thrives on cutting through ambiguity to get teams aligned and moving fast. I don't stay in my lane; I jump in wherever I'm needed to figure out what actually works. I'm cautious about overbuilding, but I do obsess over keeping systems clean enough that the team can keep improving them without losing their minds. Curious about what I’m working on? Check out my [blog](https://minjun.blog/)!
