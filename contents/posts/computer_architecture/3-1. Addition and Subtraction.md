## Addition & Subtraction

**Addition**: just do the binary addition with given numbers </br>

**Subtraction**: do the binary addition with the negation of the second operand

### Half adder

1-bit adder without carry-input

- Input: two one bit-data A, B

- Output: sum(S), carry(C)

  

### Full adder

1-bit adder with carry-input

- Input: two one bit-data A, B, carry(C$_{in}$)

- Output: sum(S), carry(C$_{out}$)

  

## Circuit design for addition and subtraction

### N-bit parallel binary adder

- Initial carry input is 0

- The i-th adder waits for the carry until it is generated by the (i-1)-th adder

### Adder with subtraction (in two's complement)

- Subtract = 0 or 1 (if subtract == 1, B$_i$ is inverted)

- Subtract is also added as the initial carry (if subtract ==1, 1 is added)

## Overflow

Overflow occurs when computation results are too large (out of range)

  

### When does it occur?

- Add two positives or negatives + the sign of result is different with sources

- Subtract a negative from a positive + the sign of result is 1

- Subtract a positive from a negative + the sign of result is 0

  

### How to detect Overflow?

- Use `add, addi, sub` instructions

- They cause exceptions on overflow

    - A program jumps to predefined exception handler address

- e.g., Fortran does not allow overflows. So MIPS Fortran compilers always use `add, addi, sub`

  

### How to ignore Overflow?

- Use `addu, addui, subu` instructions (u means unsigned)

- They do not cause exceptions on overflow

- e.g., C ignores overflows. So MIPS C compilers always use `addu, addui, subu`
