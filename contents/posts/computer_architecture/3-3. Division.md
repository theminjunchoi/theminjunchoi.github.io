## Division

If the length of Dividend and Divisor is **M** and **N**, </br>

the length of Quotient $\leqq$ M - N + 1 & the length of Remainder $ \leqq$ N

- In MIPS-based computers, 32 bits are used to represent both Dividend and Divisor. </br>Therefore, the length of both Quotient and Remainder $\leqq$ 32

</br>

  

### Optimized version of the division HW

- 32-bit divisor register / ALU

- 64-bit remainder register (dividend and quotient shares a register with remainder)

    - `HI`: Remainder

    - `LO`: Quotient

</br>

  

### Settings

- 0 is stored in the left half of the Remainder register

- The value of dividend is loaded into the right half of the Remainder register

- The value of divisor is loaded into the Divisor register

</br>

  

### Division Algorithm

</br>

  

#### Example

When N = 4 (4-bit ALU / divisor, 8-bit product), $7 \div 3$

- should be **repeated as many bits + 1 as it is**

</br>

  

### Signed division

Do division after converting both divisor & dividend to positives </br>

After the division

- Negate the quotient only if the signs of the divisor and dividend are different

- Remainder's sign follows Dividend's sign

</br>

  

### Instructions

- `div rs, rt / divu rs, rt` : do `$rs` / `$st`

    - The result (remainder and quotient) is stored in `HI` / `LO`

    - No overflow or divide-by-0 checking

</br>

  

#### Example:

- Initially, the value in `$t0` (dividend) is loaded into the `LO` register

- Initially, `$t` (divisor) is used as the divisor register

- Then, do the division and store the remainder and quotient to `HI` and `LO` registers

  

## Summary: Design for arithmetic operations

### Addition & Subtraction

Use the same HW for addition and subtraction

- 32-bit parallel adder

- Additional XOR operators + subtract bit

</br>

  

### Multiplication & Division

Use the same optimized HW for Multiplication and Division

- A single 32-bit register for multiplicand and divisor

- A single 32-bit `ALU`

- `HI` and `LO` registers for the results of multiplication and division
