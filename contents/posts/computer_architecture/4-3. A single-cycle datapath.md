## Single-cyle datapath

</br>

A single-cycle datapath executes instructions in one clock cycle with a clocking methodology. </br>

We will study how this works according to instructions

  

### R-format

![[02 7.jpg]]

- don't need to access memory

    - `MemRead` = 0

    - `MemtoReg` = 0

    - `MemWrite` = 0

- have to update value of `rd` register

    - `RegDst` = 1

    - `RegWrite` = 1

- PC just have to be updated +4

    - `branch` = 0

- ALU control determines the arithmetic type according to `ALUOp` and `func code` of instruction

</br>

  

### Load

- need to access memory and read data

    - `MemRead` = 1

    - `MemtoReg` = 1

    - `MemWrite` = 0

- have to get value from memory to `rs` field (destination)

    - `RegDst` = 0 (`rs` to destination)

    - `RegWrite` = 1

- PC just have to be updated +4

    - `branch` = 0

- ALU control determines the arithmetic type according to `ALUOp`

- offset is extended from 16-bit to 32-bit by Sign-extend unit and added with Read data 1 (base addr)

</br>

  

### Branch-on-equal

- don't need to access memory

    - `MemRead` = 0

    - `MemtoReg` = 0

    - `MemWrite` = 0

- Calculate target address

    - extend the offset to 32 bit and shift left twice (multiply 4)

    - add with `PC + 4`

- `RegDst` doesn't matter

</br>

  

### More about: jump
![[05 3.jpg]]

  

- Calculate target address

    - offset is extended to 28-bit

    - concatenate with `0000`

- `Jump signal = 1`
